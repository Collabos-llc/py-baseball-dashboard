## 🎯 First Run Instructions

### **Step 1: Verify Docker Installation**
```bash
# Check if Docker is installed
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# If not installed, download from: https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory**
```bash
cd "/Users/jeffconboy/Desktop/Py Baseball"
```

### **Step 3: Start the Application**
```bash
# Option A: Quick development start
./deploy.sh

# Option B: Manual start (if script doesn't work)
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Step 4: Access Your Dashboard**
```bash
# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8501

# Or visit manually: http://localhost:8501
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Dashboard Tabs (11 Total):**
1. **🔴 Live Games** - Today's MLB games with real-time scores
2. **🏆 Standings** - Current team standings by division
3. **🎯 Strike Zone** - Original umpire analysis
4. **🚀 Exit Velocity** - Sweet spot analysis with betting alerts
5. **🎯 Barrel Rate** - Expected vs actual home run trends
6. **⚖️ Umpire Analysis** - Strike zone bias detection
7. **🌤️ Weather Impact** - Environmental betting edges
8. **😴 Pitcher Fatigue** - Times through order analysis
9. **👤 Player Profile** - Complete scouting reports
10. **📊 Original Analysis** - Pitch type analysis
11. **🔍 Raw Data** - Data explorer

### **Services Running:**
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Dashboard Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f baseball-dashboard

# Common fix: restart everything
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### **If Live Data Tabs Show Errors:**
This is normal! Live MLB data tabs will show:
- ✅ **During MLB Season (April-October)**: Real game data
- ⚠️ **Off-Season**: "No games today" (expected)
- 🔧 **No Redis**: Fallback mode (still works, just slower)

### **Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Reset database
docker-compose down
docker volume rm py-baseball_postgres_data
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📋 Management Commands

### **Development:**
```bash
# View all service status
docker-compose ps

# View dashboard logs
docker-compose logs -f baseball-dashboard

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart baseball-dashboard

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Update and restart
./deploy.sh
```

### **Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy to production
./deploy-prod.sh

# Monitor production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

## 🎮 Testing the Integration

### **Test Live MLB Data:**
1. Go to "🔴 Live Games" tab
2. During MLB season: See today's games
3. Click "View Details" on any game
4. Check weather conditions and betting insights

### **Test Historical Analysis:**
1. Go to "🚀 Exit Velocity Analysis" tab
2. Select a date range during MLB season
3. Choose a specific team/player
4. Observe sweet spot analysis and betting alerts

### **Test Data Integration:**
1. Go to "🔍 Raw Data" tab
2. Verify PyBaseball data columns are available
3. Check that 100+ columns are loaded vs "5 basic columns"

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **API Rate Limits:**
- MLB-StatsAPI: No API key required, but rate limited
- PyBaseball: Free but can be slow for large date ranges
- Redis caching helps reduce API calls

### **Data Availability:**
- **Live Games**: Only during MLB season (April-October)
- **Historical Data**: Available year-round via PyBaseball
- **Weather Data**: Included in live game feeds when available

### **Performance:**
- First load may be slow (downloading data)
- Subsequent loads are cached and fast
- Docker containers may take 30-60 seconds to fully start

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. ✅ Test the dashboard with the above commands
2. ✅ Verify all 11 tabs load correctly
3. ✅ Check live data during MLB season

### **Optional Enhancements:**
1. **Add Real API Keys** - Edit `.env` file with actual API keys
2. **SSL Configuration** - For production HTTPS deployment
3. **Custom Analytics** - Build your own betting models
4. **Automated Alerts** - Discord/email notifications for betting edges

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Best Performance:**
- Use date ranges of 7-30 days for PyBaseball data
- Select specific teams/players for faster loading
- Let Redis cache build up over time

### **Betting Analysis:**
- Focus on "Exit Velocity" and "Weather Impact" tabs for immediate insights
- Use "Umpire Analysis" for pre-game research
- Monitor "Pitcher Fatigue" for live betting opportunities

### **Development:**
- Edit `.env` file to add real API keys
- Check logs with `docker-compose logs -f` for debugging
- Use `./deploy.sh` for quick restarts during development
